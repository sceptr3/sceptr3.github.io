By sheer luck and God's grace, I stumbled upon Detection Engineering and its inherent mission of threat hunting. This journey so far has been nothing short of wonderful and enriching, and it's my hope that you'll find your own experience to be the same, if not better.

I'm hoping that you'll find the content here meaningful, and hopefully it ignites something in you to replicate the research of your own interest. 

## Disclaimer

Most of the content you find here isn't going to be game-changingly novel. In cases where I have taken an explicit page out of someone else work, I will provide a reference to it. I do this because it's the right thing to do so. 

Thanks for reading!
